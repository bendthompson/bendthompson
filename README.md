<!-- ## Some Projects [Repos below]

### MiniMozart 🎼✍️
Created a tool to assist writing piano melodies by modelling Mozart music with RNN's in a team of 3.

[See the app here](https://cmp-web-7wc6zc723a-ew.a.run.app/)

🎹 Cleaned, transformed, and augmented audio data to create dataset of 20,000 sequences from 52 piece

🎶 Used Keras to train Recurrent Neural Network models with LSTM and Dropout layers, trained with Early Stopping

🎵 Quickly self taught specialised music packages and software using available documentation

🎻 Built Docker virtual machines with specified environments and installed software dependencies

🎺 Built a complex frontend website with Streamlit, using statefulness and API connections to run smoothly

🎸 Hosted the model API and Streamlit in a Docker virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform with custom settings

### Cinema Times 🍿
Using web scraping and calling API's to source data for all my nearby cinemas and display it in one place with Streamlit & Heroku.

[See the app here](https://cinema-times-scraper.herokuapp.com/)


🎞️ Called API's using the requests package, handling response errors and sending dynamic queries

📽️ Scraped html code using the BeautifulSoup package. Had to use various BSoup methods to work around messily structured websites

🎬 Used RegEx with English and Japanese text

📹 Gained valuable experience about the importance of data architecture and creating a data pipeline 

🎦 Used a wide range of Streamlit features to create a clear and robust frontend that was hosted on Heroku

🎥 Streamlined code to minimize number of http requests and improve runtime

📸 Maintained a structured repo, refactoring code into importable packages to keep app file tidy
 
 
### London Fire Response Times 👨‍🚒👩‍🚒  
Explored the London Fire Brigades incident response times from the start of the 999 call to the first fire engine arrival across the 32 London boroughs from 2010 to 2021.

🔥      Got good practice extracting, exploring, and cleaning data using Pandas

🚒      Stretched myself with creating highly customised plots with Matplotlib

⏱️      Learned Geopandas to handle GeoJson's and create Choropleth Map Plots
