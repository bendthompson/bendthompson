## Public Projects

### Sign Language Processing

Although not working in the field professionally, I have a particular interest in the field of Sign Language Processing (SLP) when it comes to side projects. 

It’s very unique from a technical point of view, as it combines the latest developments in both Computer Vision and NLP, which I find fascinating. Also, I feel a personal connection to the field, as my parents are Deaf and I grew up using British Sign Language.

#### 🧏‍♂️🧏‍♀️ AI Sign Language Translation for Brazilian Healthcare - Omdena Challenge  [2025]

I was Project Manager & Lead ML Engineer for the development of a Pose Estimation to LSTM Model Sign Language classifier with Omdena, a platform for social-impact AI solutions.

#### 👌👋 American Sign Language (ASL) Classifier - Personal Project [2022]

To continue honing my skills after completing the Data Science course at Le Wagon Tokyo, I developed a CNN Deep Learning model that can classify 28 different ASL signs with 89% test accuracy.

### Data Scraping & Analysis 

#### 🔥🚒 London Fire Response Times - Personal Project [2022]
Got familiar with GeoJSON data and GeoPandas by analysing the London Fire Brigades incident response times across the 32 London boroughs from 2010 to 2021.

#### 📽️🍿 Cinema Times - Personal Project [2022]
Used web scraping and called API's to source data for my frequently visited cinemas in Tokyo & Saitama, and created an interactive web app with Streamlit.
